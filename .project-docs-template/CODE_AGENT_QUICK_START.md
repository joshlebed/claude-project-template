# Code Agent Quick Start - Planning & Setup

**You are:** A planning agent creating documentation for a code implementation project.

## Your Task

Create a complete documentation structure for the project the human described.

## Steps

### 1. Create Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir .[project-slug]
cd .[project-slug]
```

Add to `.gitignore`:

```
# [Project Name] documentation
.[project-slug]/
```

### 2. Create These Files

1. **INDEX.md** - Copy from `.project-docs-template/INDEX_TEMPLATE.md` and customize
2. **PROGRESS.md** - Create from structure below
3. **[PROJECT]\_OVERVIEW.md** - High-level summary (1-2 pages)
4. **[PROJECT]\_ANALYSIS.md** - Detailed feature analysis (3-5 pages)
5. **[PROJECT]\_FILES.md** - Prioritized file list with estimates
6. **[PROJECT]\_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Exact locations with line numbers

### 3. Naming Conventions

Replace placeholders:

- `[PROJECT NAME]`: "ReadOnly Role Support"
- `[project-slug]`: "readonly-support" (for directory: `.readonly-support`)
- `[PROJECT]`: "READONLY" (for file prefixes: `READONLY_OVERVIEW.md`)
- `[project]`: "readonly support" (in prose)

### 4. Analyze the Codebase

**Be thorough:**

- Search for all relevant files
- Understand current patterns
- Identify dependencies
- Find edge cases
- Look for similar existing implementations

**Document in ANALYSIS.md:**

- Current state of each feature
- What needs to change
- Why it needs to change
- How to implement it
- Risks and gotchas

### 5. Create PROGRESS.md Structure

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Progress Tracker

**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Overall Status:** 0% Complete
**Estimated Total:** X-Y hours

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Items

_None yet_

---

## üöß In Progress

_None yet_

---

## ‚è≥ Pending - High Priority

### [Feature Area 1]

- [ ] **[Specific task]**
  - File: `path/to/file.ts`
  - Action: Brief description
  - Est: X min
  - Priority: High because [reason]

### [Feature Area 2]

...

---

## ‚è≥ Pending - Medium Priority

[Same structure]

---

## ‚è≥ Pending - Low Priority

[Same structure]

---

## üéØ Next Priority

**Start here when implementing:**

1. [First task] (Est: X min)
2. [Second task] (Est: X min)
3. [Third task] (Est: X min)

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Patterns to Follow

- [Existing pattern 1 from codebase]
- [Existing pattern 2 from codebase]

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] [Test approach 1]
- [ ] [Test approach 2]

---

## üîÑ Reprioritization Log

### YYYY-MM-DD - Initial Planning

- **High Priority:** [Reasoning - usually core functionality]
- **Medium Priority:** [Reasoning - usually nice-to-haves]
- **Low Priority:** [Reasoning - usually polish/optimization]

---

## üí° Decisions & Assumptions

- [Key decision 1 and rationale]
- [Key assumption 1 that might need validation]
```

### 6. Prioritization Guidelines

**High Priority:**

- Core functionality that must work
- Breaking changes that block other work
- Security or data integrity issues
- Features users will immediately notice

**Medium Priority:**

- Nice-to-have improvements
- Edge cases for core features
- Developer experience improvements
- Non-critical UI polish

**Low Priority:**

- Optimizations
- Cleanup and refactoring
- Documentation
- Future-proofing

### 7. Time Estimation

**Be realistic:**

- Simple file change: 5-15 min
- Component update: 15-30 min
- New component: 30-60 min
- Complex refactor: 1-2 hours
- Add 50% buffer for unknowns

**Total estimates:**

- Give ranges (e.g., "14-19 hours")
- Break into phases if > 8 hours
- Note dependencies

### 8. FILES.md Format

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Files to Modify

## High Priority (X-Y hours)

### path/to/file1.ts (Est: 20 min)

- Add [specific feature]
- Update [specific code]
- [Why it's needed]

### path/to/file2.tsx (Est: 45 min)

- [Changes needed]

## Medium Priority (X-Y hours)

[Same structure]

## Low Priority (X-Y hours)

[Same structure]
```

### 9. IMPLEMENTATION.md Format

````markdown
# [Project Name] - Implementation Details

## Feature 1: [Name]

### File: /absolute/path/to/file.ts

**Lines 45-60** (approximate)

```typescript
// Current code excerpt
```
````

**Action:** Add null check before accessing property

**New code:**

```typescript
// Example of what to add
```

**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** 10 min

---

## Feature 2: [Name]

[Same structure]

```

### 10. Quality Checks

Before showing human:
- [ ] All file paths are absolute
- [ ] Time estimates are realistic
- [ ] Priorities have clear reasoning
- [ ] Patterns from codebase are documented
- [ ] Testing approach is specified
- [ ] Next 3-5 priorities are clear
- [ ] No placeholders like [TODO] remain
- [ ] INDEX.md has project-specific info

### 11. Report to Human

Show them PROGRESS.md and summarize:
```

Created [project] documentation in .[project-slug]/:

Summary:

- Total estimated work: X-Y hours across Z files
- High Priority: A hours (core features)
- Medium Priority: B hours (enhancements)
- Low Priority: C hours (polish)

Next priorities:

1. [First item] (X min)
2. [Second item] (Y min)
3. [Third item] (Z min)

Ready to start implementation when you approve.

```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå Vague tasks like "update authentication"
‚úÖ Specific tasks like "Add isReadOnly check to login handler (LoginPage.tsx:45)"

‚ùå Missing time estimates
‚úÖ Every task has realistic estimate

‚ùå No explanation of priorities
‚úÖ Each priority level has reasoning

‚ùå Copying patterns without understanding
‚úÖ Document actual patterns found in THIS codebase

‚ùå Line numbers without file context
‚úÖ Full path + line range + what to change
