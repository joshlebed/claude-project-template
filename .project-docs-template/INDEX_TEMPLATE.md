**Current Status:** 0% Complete (0/X tasks done)
**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## üéØ Quick Start

**You are:** Implementing [brief project description]

**Start here:**
1. Read `PROGRESS.md` ‚Üí See what's done and what's next
2. Read `NEXT_STEPS.md` ‚Üí Get exact next task (if complex project)
3. Implement the changes
4. Update `PROGRESS.md` ‚Üí Mark complete, update percentage
5. Repeat

## üìÅ Documentation Files

### PROGRESS.md ‚≠ê **START HERE**
- Current completion status
- What's been implemented
- What remains (prioritized)
- Detailed completion tracking

### NEXT_STEPS.md üìã **THEN GO HERE** (if exists)
- Prioritized list of remaining tasks
- Exact files and line numbers
- Code snippets for each task
- Recommended implementation order

### [FEATURE]_GUIDE.md üìö (if exists)
- How to use [specific patterns/hooks/components]
- Code examples
- Common pitfalls
- Testing approach

## ‚úÖ Implementation Patterns

**[REPLACE THIS SECTION WITH 2-3 ACTUAL CODE PATTERNS FROM YOUR PROJECT]**

All the infrastructure is built. Just apply these patterns:

### Pattern 1: [Most Common Pattern]
```typescript
// Example code showing the pattern
import { something } from "@/somewhere";

const { value } = useSomething();

<Component disabled={!value}>
  Action
</Component>
```

### Pattern 2: [Second Most Common]
```typescript
// Another example
{condition && (
  <Component>Action</Component>
)}
```

### Pattern 3: [Third Pattern] (optional)
```typescript
// Third example if needed
```

---

## üîß Available Tools

**[REPLACE WITH ACTUAL TOOLS/HOOKS/UTILITIES FOR YOUR PROJECT]**

### Hooks
- `useXYZ()` ‚Üí Returns `{ a, b, c }`
- `useABC(id)` ‚Üí Returns `{ x, y, z }`

### Components
- `<MyWrapper>` ‚Üí Purpose and usage

### Utilities
- `CONSTANTS` from `@/path` ‚Üí What they're for

---

## üö¶ Implementation Rules

### Always:
- ‚úÖ Check `PROGRESS.md` before starting
- ‚úÖ Update `PROGRESS.md` after completing each task
- ‚úÖ Update completion percentage
- ‚úÖ Use existing patterns (see above)
- ‚úÖ Test with [specific testing approach]
- ‚úÖ Run `npm run lint:fix` after changes (or relevant command)

### Never:
- ‚ùå Skip tasks - do them in order
- ‚ùå Create new patterns - use existing ones
- ‚ùå Batch completions - update after each task
- ‚ùå Use try-except or fallbacks (per project rules)

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] [Specific requirement 1]
- [ ] [Specific requirement 2]
- [ ] [Specific requirement 3]
- [ ] No regressions in [what to preserve]
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors

---

## üìû When You Get Stuck

1. Check `PROGRESS.md` for notes and patterns
2. Check `[GUIDE].md` for examples (if exists)
3. Document blocker in `PROGRESS.md` under "Issues & Blockers"
4. Ask the human for clarification

## Project Context

**Purpose:** [1-2 sentence description of what this achieves]

**Key Constraints:**
- [Constraint 1 - e.g., must maintain backward compatibility]
- [Constraint 2 - e.g., follow existing pattern from FileX.tsx]
- [Constraint 3 - e.g., no breaking changes to API]

**Architecture Notes:**
- [How this fits into the system]
- [What layer is responsible for what]
- [Security/performance considerations]

**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## üìã Instructions for Planning Agent

When you create this INDEX.md for a new project:

### 1. Copy Template Structure
Copy this file to `.[project-slug]/INDEX.md`

### 2. Fill In Project Info
- **Title**: Replace `[PROJECT NAME]` with actual name
- **Status**: Set to `0% Complete (0/X tasks done)` initially
- **Quick Start**: Write 1 sentence describing what's being implemented

### 3. Add Real Implementation Patterns
**CRITICAL**: Don't leave generic examples!
- Find 2-3 most common patterns in the codebase
- Copy actual code (not pseudo-code)
- Show imports, hook usage, component structure
- Make it copy-paste ready

### 4. Document Available Tools
List actual hooks/components/utilities:
- Their exact import paths
- What they return/do
- When to use them

### 5. Set Up Progress Table
- List actual modules that will be changed
- Count actual files per module
- Set realistic priorities

### 6. Define Success Criteria
- Specific, measurable requirements
- What must still work (no regressions)
- Testing requirements

### 7. Add Project Context
- Why this change is needed
- Critical constraints (backward compatibility, patterns to follow)
- Architecture considerations
- Security/performance notes

### 8. Create Companion Files

**Always create:**
- `PROGRESS.md` with detailed task breakdown

**Create if 10+ tasks:**
- `NEXT_STEPS.md` with step-by-step instructions and code snippets

**Create if reusable pattern:**
- `[FEATURE]_GUIDE.md` with comprehensive examples
- `[FEATURE]_SUMMARY.md` with quick reference

**Don't create:**
- Verbose analysis documents
- Redundant file lists
- Implementation docs (put in NEXT_STEPS instead)

### 9. Keep It Focused
- INDEX.md should be 1-2 pages max
- Action-oriented (do this) not academic (here's why)
- Examples over explanations
- Show, don't tell

### 10. Remove This Section
Delete "Instructions for Planning Agent" before saving.
