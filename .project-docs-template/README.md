# Project Documentation Template - Human Guide

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Project Documentation

After exploring the codebase, ask your AI agent:

```
Based on our conversation, create project documentation using the template at @.project-docs-template/

Name the project and create an appropriate directory (e.g., @.my-project/).
Follow the best practices in the template README.
Show me INDEX.md and PROGRESS.md when done.
```

### 2. Review and Approve

Check the generated docs:

**INDEX.md:**

- Clear quick start?
- Implementation patterns visible?
- Links to next steps?

**PROGRESS.md:**

- Reasonable time estimates?
- Correct priorities?
- Percentage complete tracked?

**NEXT_STEPS.md (if complex project):**

- Step-by-step tasks?
- Code snippets provided?
- Clear sequencing?

### 3. Start Implementation

```
Follow INDEX.md in @.[project-slug]/ and implement the next priority task.
Update PROGRESS.md after each task.
```

## Core Documentation Structure

### Essential Files (Always Create)

1. **INDEX.md** - Agent's entry point

   - Quick start workflow
   - Implementation patterns (with code examples)
   - Links to other docs
   - Keep to 1-2 pages max

2. **PROGRESS.md** - Live progress tracker
   - What's completed (with dates)
   - What's in progress
   - What's pending (prioritized)
   - Progress percentage and time estimates
   - Update after EVERY task

### Optional Files (Only If Needed)

3. **NEXT_STEPS.md** - For complex projects (10+ tasks)

   - Numbered task list with exact instructions
   - Code snippets for each task
   - File paths and line numbers
   - Testing criteria per task

4. **[FEATURE]\_GUIDE.md** - For reusable patterns

   - When agent will use same pattern 5+ times
   - Code examples
   - Common pitfalls
   - Testing approach

5. **[FEATURE]\_SUMMARY.md** - Quick reference
   - Permission matrices
   - Decision tables
   - Backend verification status

### Files to AVOID Creating

❌ **ANALYSIS.md** - Too verbose, info goes in PROGRESS.md
❌ **FILES.md** - File lists go in NEXT_STEPS.md with tasks
❌ **IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Exact code goes in NEXT_STEPS.md
❌ Multiple overlapping docs - Consolidate!

---

## Keeping Agent On Track

### After each task:

```
Mark task X as complete in PROGRESS.md.
Update the percentage complete.
Show me what you did and what's next.
```

### When priorities change:

```
Update PROGRESS.md: move [task] to high priority because [reason].
Add note to reprioritization log.
```

### When agent gets stuck:

```
Document the blocker in PROGRESS.md under "Issues & Blockers".
Describe what you tried.
Ask me for guidance.
```

### To check progress:

```
Show current completion percentage and next 3 tasks from PROGRESS.md.
```

### To give feedback:

```
In [file], [specific issue]. Fix it to [correct approach].
Document this pattern in PROGRESS.md so you remember.
```

### After context limit or long break:

```
Read all files in .[project]/ starting with INDEX.md.
Summarize: what's done, current state, next priority.
```

## Documentation Best Practices

### ✅ DO

**Keep it focused:**

- Each file has ONE clear purpose
- Remove info once it's no longer useful
- Consolidate overlapping content

**Make it action-oriented:**

- "Do this next" >> "Here's background info"
- Code snippets >> Long explanations
- Step-by-step >> Comprehensive analysis

**Track progress visibly:**

- Update percentage after each task
- Show remaining time estimates
- Mark completed items immediately

**Provide examples:**

- Code patterns with actual syntax
- Copy-paste ready snippets
- Working reference implementations

### ❌ DON'T

**Create noise:**

- Don't make 10 docs when 5 will do
- Don't duplicate info across files
- Don't keep outdated info

**Be vague:**

- Don't say "update the file" - give line numbers
- Don't say "follow the pattern" - show the code
- Don't say "implement X" - break into steps

**Lose track:**

- Don't batch progress updates
- Don't let PROGRESS.md get stale
- Don't skip updating completion percentage

---

## When to Use This Template

✅ **Use for:**

- Multi-day projects (3+ hours of work)
- 10+ files to modify
- Unclear scope needing research
- Complex refactoring across modules
- Projects spanning multiple sessions

❌ **Skip for:**

- Single file changes
- Quick bug fixes (< 1 hour)
- Well-defined small tasks
- Simple find-and-replace operations

## Example: Good vs Bad Structure

### ❌ Bad (Too Much)

```
.[project]/
├── INDEX.md
├── PROGRESS.md
├── PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md       ← Redundant with INDEX
├── PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md        ← Too verbose
├── PROJECT_FILES.md           ← Belongs in NEXT_STEPS
├── PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION.md  ← Belongs in NEXT_STEPS
├── PROJECT_TESTING.md         ← Belongs in PROGRESS
├── PROJECT_DECISIONS.md       ← Belongs in PROGRESS
└── PROJECT_NOTES.md           ← Belongs in PROGRESS
```

### ✅ Good (Focused)

```
.[project]/
├── INDEX.md          ← Quick start + patterns
├── PROGRESS.md       ← Live tracking + decisions
├── NEXT_STEPS.md     ← Task-by-task guide (if complex)
└── HOOKS_GUIDE.md    ← Reusable pattern guide (if needed)
```
